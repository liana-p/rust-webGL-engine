# rust-webGL-engine
Trying to build a proof of concept basic Rust 3D WebGL engine

Currently using my fork of [stdweb](https://github.com/nialna/stdweb/tree/webglRenderer) with a WebGLRenderingContext, because stdweb doesn't have it yet.

Will eventually use the main plugin when it gets there.

Only fills the screen using `gl.clear();` for now
